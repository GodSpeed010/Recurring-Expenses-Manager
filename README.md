# Recurring-Expenses-Manager
This project is an Android App created during Shellhacks 2022 hackathon. It is a mock of a recurring expenses app that allows you to see all your recurring subscriptions in one place along with useful data about them, including the option to cancel them if you wish to do so.

Additionally, the app sends you a notification reminder every 3 months about your subscriptions asking you to confirm whether you still use them or not, preventing unused subscriptions from taking your money. 
If you don't use them, the app can help you cancel those subscriptions. Otherwise, the app will do nothing and send you another reminder in 3 months.
